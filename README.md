TODO:

- Add an "entity" for the oil fracking device. This could be either in the form of a pumpjack that is modified to force an input fluid (fracking-sludge), or an electric mining drill (akin to uranium) that takes fracking-sludge. This would then output
'oil-shale'.
  -- If adding oil-shale, then that must be created as well.

- In game, the icons are bugged, when hovering over they display an 'unknown key' and then just the file name w/ path. FIX.

- Finish graphics, as they are very simple and just bug standard ms.paint. Technology graphic is broken in game.
