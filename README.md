V_0.0.2
-unreleased
Creates an alternative method to gathering oil, via fracking! The solid shale is retrieved via a more complex method, but you are rewarded wth much more (and much more portable) oil! Watch for pollution though...

TODO:
- Finish graphics, as they are very simple and just bug standard ms.paint. Technology graphic is broken in game.
- Finish oil shale generation data, it is too big, and too much
-   Remove oil shale? Generate liquid ("fracking-cracks') instead. 
- Remove larger oil patches? Keep them rare, for balance.
- Make the 'fracking-drill' specific to shale.
- Add 'category' for the fracking pumpjack OR drill. So only oil-shale / fracking-cracks will accept those entitys. Refer to K2 categories and quarry drill for ref.
