V_0.0.2

Creates an alternative method to gathering oil, via fracking! The solid shale is retrieved via a more complex method, but you are rewarded wth much more (and much more portable) oil! Watch for pollution though...

TODO:

- In game, the icons are bugged, when hovering over they display an 'unknown key' and then just the file name w/ path. FIX.
- 
- Finish graphics, as they are very simple and just bug standard ms.paint. Technology graphic is broken in game.
- Finish oil shale generation data, it is too big, and too much
- Remove larger oil patches? Keep them rare, for balance.

IDEAS:

- New goal of the game, pollution. Reduce air standards so much that the world goes extinct and perishes.
- Remove clean energy?, and by default increase biter stats. This makes it much harder to grow as a base, as you would need to balance your petroleum creation with oil shale outposts that spit tons of pollution & by extension, bring tons of biters.
- Add new vehicles.
- Add new buildings that spit more pollution. Potentially 'factories', that are just upgraded (and larger) assembly machines and they spit TONS of pollution but their quality is worth it.
- Biter nests absorb pollution to a point, where after absorbing so much over a life time they will unleash everything they have and self destruct in the process. Biters also do not expand into the pollution cloud, but rather expand like rabbits outside of the cloud. Making the cloud an actual safe haven to build in, as long as you are prepared for the attacks associated.
- Add a new building for fracking sludge. Add a new building for using the shale (this will be the main form of energy creation, so it has to be *difficult* but not *annoying* to set up multiple times.
- Balance!
- Make solar panels & accumulators 'decay' and you must recycle the byproducts. Make a cooler recipe -- idk bout this one though
- Make nuclear waste... a real problem. Instead of just fuel cells, it also produces waste that must be placed in a solid building behind walls??? --idk bout this one though.
