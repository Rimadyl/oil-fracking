V_0.0.2

Creates an alternative method to gathering oil, via fracking! The solid shale is retrieved via a more complex method, but you are rewarded wth much more (and much more portable) oil! Watch for pollution though...

TODO:

- In game, the icons are bugged, when hovering over they display an 'unknown key' and then just the file name w/ path. FIX.
- 
- Finish graphics, as they are very simple and just bug standard ms.paint. Technology graphic is broken in game.
- Finish oil shale generation data, it is too big, and too much
- Remove larger oil patches? Keep them rare, for balance.
- Make the 'fracking-drill' specific to shale.
